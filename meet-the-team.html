She is proud of her Buckeye heritage, having lived in Ohio all her life except when wanderlust took her to Texas, Florida, and England. As a practicing Occupational Therapist in Texas, she first learned her love of working with adults.

From here, she specialized in acute care, further developing her therapy skills and love for helping adults return to their maximum potential.

In 2014, she expanded her role at The Vision Performance Center and joined the Neuro-Vision Rehabilitation team - since then, Holly has not looked back! She uses her expertise in the areas of visual processing, sensory integration and vestibular rehab to help those with concussion, stroke, and other neurological diagnoses return to active lifestyles. Holly is also an expert in Sports Vision Therapy, working with athletes in a variety of sports from high school to the professional level. She can’t describe her job without using words like, “life-changing”, “totally fulfilling” and “best job ever”. Holly lives with her husband, Mike, in Westerville, Ohio and their wonderful dog, Beckham. She has two grown daughters, Mae and Ellise, who are pursuing college degrees. In her spare time, you’ll find Holly spending time with her family, gardening, or volunteering in the community.

                        <p>Sarah Pyle was born in Beloit Wisconsin, but has lived in various parts of Ohio since she was 5 years old. Following in her eldest sister’s footsteps, who is an Occupational Therapist, in 1999 Sarah has spent her time as an OTA/L working with both the adult and pediatric population in many different settings and feels very fortunate that she has always loved what she gets to do for a living. She started working here in the fall of 2008 transitioning from part time to full time over the years. She loves how unique and rewarding her work has always been here.

The best part is the unique collaboration amongst optometrists and therapists to meet each patient’s individual needs during their time in therapy. She feels it is important to view each patient as a person, not just the injury or diagnoses. Educating others, especially patients and their families is her favorite part of the job!</p>

                        <p>Stacey Gonya was born and raised in Columbus Ohio. After graduating from the American Institute of Alternative Medicine, Stacey worked as a licensed massage therapist. Most of his massage career was spent in various medical settings including chiropractic offices and wellness clinics. In 2011 Stacey graduated from Clark State College in Springfield Ohio with an Associate’s degree in Applied Sciences going on to earn his physical therapy assistant license. The geriatric population was his primary focus, helping patients regain their function and independence, thus bettering their quality of life. Stacey joined the team in 2019 and hasn’t looked back. Four years later, he is still grateful to be a part of such a unique and specialized clinic. Although he does not have a clinical role, he really enjoys building a rapport with the patients and watching them get better. When not at the office, Stacey enjoys spending time with his wife, Jen and their two kids, Oliver and Finn. The newest addition to the family is a Boston terrier, Georgia Blue, what she lacks in manners she makes up for in personality. Playing cards, exercising, watching most any sporting event, baking and spending time in nature are some other activities that put a smile on his face.</p>
