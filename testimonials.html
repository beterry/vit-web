                        <p>I was involved in a serious car accident in February 2016 at the age of 62.</p>
                        <p>After two weeks flat on my back in bed, in a dark room on pain medication, I began the slow process of recovery. I only left my home for Doctor appointments and physical therapy for months afterward. I was constantly dizzy and light headed therefore restricted from driving. I went to several specialists, a psychologist for stress and trauma therapy, and physical therapy for the bodily injuries. The constant dizziness continued and on June 21st I fainted in my home, hitting my head resulting in a second concussion and re-injuring my neck. Months of physical therapy followed yet the dizziness and light headed feeling remained. Eventually, my Physical Therapists informed me that there was nothing more they could do to help me and felt there was a “disconnect” between my eyes and my brain. I was referred to Dr. Curtis for evaluation and his therapy for which I am very grateful!!</p>
                        <p>In my initial meeting, Dr. Curtis and his staff performed many visual examinations and tests and determined I was a candidate for vision rehabilitation therapy. The first 4 days of therapy my symptoms did increase as Dr. Curtis prepared me they would. Thereafter, however I felt better each day. As I write this, I have completed 30 days of treatment and have my follow up appointment with Dr. Curtis and retesting today. I am looking forward to seeing how dramatically my test results will have improved!</p>
                        <p>The therapy included light therapy, vestibular therapy, eye movement therapy and auditory training. It is an amazing procedure and it worked for me. I went into this treatment with a very positive attitude and much excitement as I felt I was finally on the right path to resolve the constant dizziness I had been dealing with since February. I highly recommend Dr. Curtis and his professional staff. They are very dedicated to their patients and certainly helped me resolve the dizziness from the accident. I am very grateful for their help.”</p>

                        <p>We are so grateful to Shelley and the team at VPC!!  Langston has Cerebral Palsy, which impacts his eye muscles and contributes to vision concerns. We, his parents, were taking him to intensive physical therapy programs throughout the country to help him walk, but realized that vision issues were likely interfering with his progress in balance, impeding his overall gross motor progress, limiting his visual attention, and leading to disinterest in reading, coloring, and early academic tasks.  A friend recommended Dr. Curtis, Shelley, and the team at VPC and we are glad they did!  Since Langston completed the photosyntonic light therapy program and we added Shelley to his regular therapy team, it seems like we’re starting to see new skills emerge every day.  He is more aware of his surroundings, and uses his vision to support his body awareness and movement, providing a foundation for major gross motor progress.  Langston has learned to recognize objects from across the room, visually locate objects even when the background is “busy,” and visually discriminate between similar inputs (ie letters and numbers).  When working with Langston, we see him visually attending to the letters on a page, scanning left to right, and showing us he is ready to tackle his next big academic challenge… READING!  When we started this process, his visual acuity was measured at 20/200 and he did not have enough visual attention to even look at the images presented across the room.  About 18 months later, his visual acuity was measured as 20/30 because he was able to attend to the visual information and participate in the process.  We are thankful for Shelley’s attention to Langston’s needs, patience in letting him guide therapy sessions, setting high expectations for Langston, knowledge of all aspects of vision and its impact on learning, her love for Langston, and for joining his therapy team.  She has provided Langston with a solid vision foundation, and we are excited to see what else will grow from those roots.</p>

                        <p>I was referred to Dr. Curtis due to having a concussion after a motor vehicle accident. I had never heard of this type of therapy, but I was open to try anything that could potentially get me back to my normal life. Dr. Curtis is very caring and put me at ease. He explained things clearly, and answered all of my questions. Most importantly, he made me feel like everything was going to be okay, and that I’m not alone. All of the staff (Holly, OT, Ect.) are very professional, and they also explained things clearly.  I completed the 30 day program at the end of August. I’m slowly transitioning back to work. My symptoms are not completely gone, but I’m better now than I was five months ago. I had my 90 day checkup and he provided me with a three week light therapy plan at home that I’m currently doing. I believe I me Dr. Curtis for a reason. I have spoke to many people about his program, including my Primary care physician who is very interested in this therapy. This can benefit both children and adults. I feel blessed to have met Dr. Curtis and his staff, and to have participated in this program. I highly recommend people to at least meet him and get more information for yourself or your child.</p>

                        <p>Eye therapy helped me to fall in love with reading again. Before eye therapy, it was hard to focus on reading and I got frustrated. I stopped reading almost entirely. I’m also in band and the music was harder to read. Once I started therapy, reading got easier. My eye therapist’s name was Sarah. She was amazing. She always had energy and would let me be silly during our sessions. She made eye therapy super fun. As a result of eye therapy, I started to read again and band music was easier. I was able to enjoy books such as “The Outsiders” and “The Hunger Games.” These are the ways eye therapy has helped me.</p>

                        <p>In searching for solutions for my daughters difficulties in learning to read I was incredibly fortunate to come across Dr. Steven Curtis. He was able to assess rather quickly the issues she was having with her eyes that were inhibiting a very bright child from learning to read. Dr. Curtis recommended vision therapy. The commitment to vision therapy gave my daughter life changing results. By the end of therapy she was not only caught up to grade level but soon exceeded grade level shortly after. Unexpected results were, her balance, and being able to finally ride a bike, play sports because of improved hand eye coordination. And her over active constant movement became that of a normal active kid. She developed over time more ability to sit and focus for longer periods. The benefits were immediate and continued to progress for about six months to a year. I found Dr. Curtis and his staff to be honest, caring, and of great integrity. If your child is having issues or has been “labeled” I highly recommend a consultation with Dr. Curtis.</p>

                        <p>We've been utilizing The Vision Performance Center now for about two years and have benefited immensely! Thanks to the Vision Performance Center our 8 year old son, Asher (with severe hyperopia, amblyopia, and strabismus) has been able to improve his amblyopia from 20/75 to 20/30 in a very short amount of time. The Vision Performance Center offers a very one-of-a-kind type of therapy for growing children with various eye conditions. In therapy they focus on the brain-vision-body connection and aim to address them simultaneously! Genius. For example, very early on in therapy, Miss Shelley, noticed Asher's retained primitive reflexes and worked to resolve those issues, while also incorporating various vision therapy techniques. The gains that were made once vision and body movement deficits were addressed together were incomparable to other basic vision therapy we have received in the past. I have noticed that most of the therapy techniques at VPC have kids out of their seats and moving--enhancing the brain-vision-body connection. Each week therapy is different and includes things like games, interactive computer games, and virtual reality!</p>
                        <p>Our son continues to make gains in his amblyopia, figure ground perception, and body awareness thanks to his wonderful therapist, Miss Shelley, who is experienced, innovative, friendly, and will tell you the honest truth, not just what you want to hear. The VPC works miracles with their unique 'whole child' approach! My son's quality of life has improved thanks to the innovative therapy methods at the VPC. We are so thankful!</p>

Dr. Steve Curtis came highly recommended and after a lengthy examination, we learned that it was Ella’s eyes that were causing the reading issues, not necessarily a learning disability.  We soon enrolled her in weekly eye therapy sessions and noticed a difference within a month.  Ella’s reading became more fluent and she gained the confidence that she had been lacking.</p>
                        <p>Working with Shelley has been amazing.  Ella truly enjoyed the time that she spent with her and any parent can tell that Shelley has a genuine concern for her patients.  She is nurturing and patient; two qualities that are necessarily when working with children.  As a result of 4 months of eye therapy, Ella has jumped 2 grade levels in reading and her math skills have improved a great deal.  I would, without a doubt, recommend the Vision Performance Center of Columbus to any parent.</p>
