                <h3><strong>What</strong> are the benefits</h3>
                <p>The Vision Integration Team of Columbus fosters growth in these skill areas:</p>
                <h4>Functional Vision Skills</h4>
                <p>Functional vision is your ability to move, team and focus your eyes to gather information from the world around you. These skills can become impaired after a neurological insult or perhaps they were underdeveloped from birth. These skills include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eye alignment</li>
                    <li>Eye tracking and eye teaming</li>
                    <li>Eye focusing abilities</li>
                    <li>Eye movement control</li>
                    <li>Visual processing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Studies indicate that 30 to 60% of children with learning delays have vision problems. Most of these children have passed the standard vision screening at school or at the pediatrician’s office, testing only a child’s visual acuity.  Often it is the child’s functional vision skills that are the actual roadblocks to learning.</p>
                <p>When dealing with concussion and other neurological injuries, nearly 50 percent of adults experience symptoms related to vision and visual processing. For adolescents, the number rises to a staggering 69 percent!</p>
                <h4>Sensory Processing Skills</h4>
                <p>Sensory Processing is the ability to receive, organize, interpret, and utilize information from the world around us. When our systems are processing information and communicating effectively, our bodies can achieve a calm, organized state to efficiently attend to activities. Efficient sensory processing skills allow us to attend to, organize, sequence, problem solve, and execute activities appropriately. Sensory integration is a therapeutic approach used in conjunction with functional skill development to help children and adults process and respond to stimuli in their environment.</p>
                <h4>Sensory Motor Skills</h4>
                <p>Sensory motor skills are basic underlying skills that influence learning, behavior and performance. Skills such as motor planning, crossing midline, body awareness, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and bilateral coordination rely heavily on vision and other sensory stimulation. To achieve good motor skill development, an individual must have good awareness of his/her own body and the space around them. During therapy, we assess and help patients re-visit and achieve milestones that may not be fully developed or have gotten disrupted from an accident or illness, giving them the foundation they need to achieve age-appropriate skill development or acquisition for desired performance.</p>
